# Principles

## SOLID Principles

### Single Responsibility

A module should have only one source of change.

```javascript
```

### Open/Close

A module should be open for extension and closed for modification.

### Liskov substitution

A module should be interchangeable with any module that implements the same interface.

### Interface segregation

A module should use local data objects and not depend on objects from other sub-systems.

### Dependency inversion

The specific implementation should depend on the abstracted business logic
